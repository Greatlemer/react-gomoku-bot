Deal with 5x5 segments of the board
Use references to cells so memory usage doesn't go overboard and the cell that was played only needs to be updated once
Keep references as to which segments include a cell so we can limit number of cells that need to be scanned after each turn to 25
Track if a segment is at the top or the left so certain things like checking columns or rows can be shortcutted
Have an `identifyThreatsAndOpportunities` function that returns an object mapping out different threat and opportunity levels based on the number of turns it would take to win from that position.
Using the following weights calculate a score for each cell (each weight is 25 * the lower + 1):
  1-turn-opportunity = 16406
  1-turn-threat = 3281
  2-turn-threat = 656
  2-turn-opportunity = 131
  3-turn-threat = 26
  3-turn-opportunity = 1
  empty = 0
  non-empty = -1
Play the cell with the highest score, if there are multiple cells with the same highest score tiebreak by playing one at random.
